# Problem Statement

![/img/content-blog-raw-blog-predicting-electronics-resale-price-untitled.png](/img/content-blog-raw-blog-predicting-electronics-resale-price-untitled.png)

# Objective

Predict the resale price based on brand, part id and purchase quantity

# Milestones

- Data analysis and discovery - What is the acceptable variance the model needs to meet in terms of similar part number and quantity?
- Model research and validation - Does the model meet the variance requirement? (Variance of the model should meet or be below the variance of the sales history)
- Model deployment - Traffic will increase 10 fold. So, model needs to be containerized or dockerized
- Training - Model needs to be trainable on new sales data. Methodology to accept or reject the variance of the newly trained model documented.

# Deliverables

1. Data Analysis and Discovery (identify target variance for pricing model in terms of similar part numbers and quantities). Analysis should be done on the 12 following quantity ranges: 1-4, 5-9, 10-24, 25-49, 50-99, 100-249, 250-499, 500-999, 1000-2499, 2500-4999, 5000-9999, 10000+.

2. ModelA Training (Resale Value Estimation [$] (Brand+PartNo.+Quantity)

3. ModelA Validation (variance analysis and comparison with sales history variance in terms of similar part numbers and quantities)

4. ModelA Containerization

5. ModelA re-training based on new sales data

6. ScriptA to calculate variance for new sales data (feedback for training results)

7. Documentation for re-training

8. ModelA deployment and API

# Modeling Approach

### Framework

- Fully connected regression neural network
- NLP feature extraction from part id
- Batch generator to feed large data in batches
- Hyperparameter tuning to find the best model fit

### List of Variables

- 2 years of sales history
- PRC
- PARTNO
- ORDER_NUMBER
- ORIG_ORDER_QTY
- UNIT_COST
- UNIT_REASLE
- UOM (UNIT OF MEASUREMENT)

# Bucket of Ideas

1. Increase n-gram range; e.g. in part_id ABC-123-23, these are 4-grams: ABC-, BC-1, C-12, -123, 123-, 23-2, 3-23; Idea is to see if increasing this range further will increase the model's performance
2. Employ Char-level LSTM to capture sequence information; e.g. in same part_id ABC-123-23, currently we are not maintaining sequence of grams, we don't know if 3-23 is coming at first or last; here, the idea is to see if lstm model can be employed to capture this sequence information to improve model's performance
3. New Loss function - including cost based loss
