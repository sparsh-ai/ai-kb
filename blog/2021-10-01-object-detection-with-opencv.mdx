## **Face detection**

We will use the frontal face Haar cascade classifier model to detect faces in the given image. The following function first passes the given image into the classifier model to detect a list of face bounding boxes and then runs a loop to draw a red rectangle box around each detected face in the image:

```python
def detect_faces(fix_img):
    face_rects = face_classifier.detectMultiScale(fix_img)
    for (x, y, w, h) in face_rects:
        cv2.rectangle(fix_img,
                     (x,y),
                     (x+w, y+h),
                     (255,0,0),
                     10)
    return fix_img
```

## **Eyes detection**

The process is almost similar to the face detection process. Instead of frontal face Haar cascade, we will use the eye detection Haar cascade model.

## **Pedestrian detection**

We will use the full-body Haar cascade classifier model for pedestrian detection. We will apply this model to a video this time. The following function will run the model on each frame of the video to detect the pedestrians:

```python
# While Loop
while cap.isOpened():
    # Read the capture
		ret, frame = cap.read()
    # Pass the Frame to the Classifier
		bodies = body_classifier.detectMultiScale(frame, 1.2, 3)
    # if Statement
		if ret == True:
        # Bound Boxes to Identified Bodies
				for (x,y,w,h) in bodies:
            cv2.rectangle(frame,
                         (x,y),
                         (x+w, y+h),
                         (25,125,225),
                         5)
            cv2.imshow('Pedestrians', frame) 
        # Exit with Esc button
				if cv2.waitKey(1) == 27:
            break  
    # else Statement
		else:
        break
    
# Release the Capture & Destroy All Windows
cap.release()
cv2.destroyAllWindows()
```

## **Car detection**

The process is almost similar to the pedestrian detection process. Again, we will use this model on a video. Instead of people Haar cascade, we will use the car cascade model.

## **Car number plate detection**

The process is almost similar to the face and eye detection process. We will use the car number plate cascade model.
