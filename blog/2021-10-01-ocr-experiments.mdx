## 1. Tesseract

Tesseract is an open-source text recognition engine that is available under the Apache 2.0 license and its development has been sponsored by Google since 2006.

## 2. EasyOCR

Ready-to-use OCR with 70+ languages supported including Chinese, Japanese, Korean and Thai. EasyOCR is built with Python and Pytorch deep learning library, having a GPU could speed up the whole process of detection. The detection part is using the CRAFT algorithm and the Recognition model is CRNN. It is composed of 3 main components, feature extraction (we are currently using Resnet), sequence labelling (LSTM) and decoding (CTC). EasyOCR doesnâ€™t have much software dependencies, it can directly be used with its API.

## 3. KerasOCR

This is a slightly polished and packaged version of the Keras CRNN implementation and the published CRAFT text detection model. It provides a high-level API for training a text detection and OCR pipeline and out-of-the-box OCR models, and an end-to-end training pipeline to build new OCR models.

## 4. ArabicOCR

It is an OCR system for the Arabic language that converts images of typed text to machine-encoded text. It currently supports only letters (29 letters).  ArabicOCR aims to solve a simpler problem of OCR with images that contain only Arabic characters (check the dataset link below to see a sample of the images).
