### Market

Livestream ecommerce has been surging dramatically in China. According to Forbes, this industry is estimated to earn $60 billion annually. In 2019, about 37 percent of the online shoppers in China (265 million people) made livestream purchases. On Taobao’s 2020 annual Single-Day Global Shopping Festival (November 11th), livestreams accounted for $6 billion in sales (twice the amount from the prior year).

Amazon has also launched its live platform, where influencers promote items and chat with potential customers. And Facebook and Instagram are exploring the integration between ecommerce and social media. For instance, the new Shop feature on Instagram allows users to browse products and place orders directly within Instagram — a form of social commerce.

The total GMV driven by live streaming achieved $6 Billion USD. Some quantitative research results show that adopting live streaming in sales can achieve a 21.8% increase in online sales volume.

A typical livestream session has the following basic components:

1. **The video stream,** where the host shows the products, talks about them, and answers questions from the audience. In the Amazon Live case, the stream occupies the most of the screen space.
2. **The list of products being promoted**, with the product currently being shown highlighted. This list appears at the bottom of the Amazon video stream.
3. **A chat area,** where viewers can type questions and comments to interact with the host and other viewers. The chat area is at the right of the live stream on Amazon Live.
4. **A reaction button, that users** can use to send reactions, displayed as animated emojis. The reaction button shows up as a little star icon at the bottom right of the video stream on Amazon.
