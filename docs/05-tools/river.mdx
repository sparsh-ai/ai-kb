# River

[River](https://github.com/online-ml/river) is a Python library for [online machine learning](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Online_machine_learning). It is the result of a merger between [creme](https://github.com/MaxHalford/creme) and [scikit-multiflow](https://github.com/scikit-multiflow/scikit-multiflow). River's ambition is to be the go-to library for doing machine learning on streaming data.

Here are some benefits of using River (and online machine learning in general):

- **Incremental**: models can update themselves in real-time.
- **Adaptive**: models can adapt to [concept drift](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Concept_drift).
- **Production-ready**: working with data streams makes it simple to replicate production scenarios during model development.
- **Efficient**: models don't have to be retrained and require little compute power, which [lowers their carbon footprint](https://arxiv.org/abs/1907.10597)
- **Fast**: when the goal is to learn and predict with a single instance at a time, then River is an order of magnitude faster than PyTorch, Tensorflow, and scikit-learn.
