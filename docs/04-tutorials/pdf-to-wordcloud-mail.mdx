- Step 7 - Creating Wordcloud using matplotlib and wordcloud libraries
- Step 8 - Importing required libraries like smtplib, MIME, win32 for sending the mail
- Step 9 - Create outlook mail object with supporting data like filepath attachment, recepient address, mail body etc.
- Step 10 - Sending the mail with required wordcloud image file attached and checking if mail is received or not!
