## Introduction

- **Definition: Object tracking is the process of 1)** Taking an initial set of object detections (such as an input set of bounding box coordinates, 2) Creating a unique ID for each of the initial detections, and then 3) tracking each of the objects as they move around frames in a video, maintaining the assignment of unique IDs.
- **Applications:** In-store consumer behavior tracking, Apply security policies like crowd management, traffic management, vision-based control, human-computer interface, medical imaging, augmented reality, robotics.
- **Scope:** Track objects in images and videos, 2-dimensional tracking, Bounding boxes and pixel masks, Single and Multiple Object Tracking
- **Tools:** Detectron2, OpenCV

## Process flow

Step 1: Collect the data

Capture via camera, scrap from the internet or use public datasets

Step 2: Train Object Detection Model

Train an object detector model (or use existing one if available in open-source domain)

Step 3: Annotate the data

Apply object detector on the images to create a training set for object tracking

Step 4: Data Preparation

Clean the data and make it ready for modeling

Step 5: Train the Tracker

Build and train an object tracking model (e.g. DeepSORT, FairMOT) to accurately track the target object in images/videos. Track the progress and experiments

Step 6: Model Validation

Validate the final set of models and select/assemble the final model

Step 7: UAT Testing

Wrap the model inference engine in API for client testing

Step 8: Deployment

Deploy the model on cloud or edge as per the requirement

Step 9: Documentation

Prepare the documentation and transfer all assets to the client
