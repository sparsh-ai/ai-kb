Because this data is often unstructured, it may be stored in graph, document, or other non-relational databases.With the increasing volume and velocity of data, and the use of data lakes along with data warehouses to enable data-driven decisions, businesses needed better ways to scale and share business intelligence. One such path was through interactive, immersive exploration and visualization of the data, as pioneered with Spotfire.
