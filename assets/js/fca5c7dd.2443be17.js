Integrating all these different forms of feedback is critical to building systems that users love to use, and that do not optimize for any one metric at the expense of overall performance. In addition, building a joint model for multiple tasks may produce better results than building a number of task-specific models. This is especially true where some data is abundant (for example, clicks), and some data is sparse (purchases, returns, manual reviews).
